    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);

    // This will reference the original array
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // orr create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // This will create a new array, and take all iterables and put it
    //into the containing array (it makes a copy)q
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "yippeeee skippeee";
    // console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
